# Planetary

### What is planetary?
`planetary` is a simple website where you can view and add planets

### What tehnologies I used?
I made the server with Node and Express and added MongoDB as my database.\
For templating I used EJS.

### What I realized in this project?
* A presentation page
* A page with all the planets
* A page to views the full planet
* A page where you can add a planet
* A hidden 404 page

### What I wanted to realize more?
* To implement the Edit and Delete buttons and actions
* To have a category page for all the planets
* The search bar is kind of dummy, you have to guess the exact name of the planet in order to get a response
